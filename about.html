<h2>Where do I come from?</h2>
<article>
<h4><u>Berkshire County Massachussetts</u></h4><p>
<b>The Berkshires</b> is the western most county in Mass. Depending on your reaons for visiting, the main<br>town or city could vary between North Adams, Great Barrington, Pittsdfield, or Stockbridge.<br><br>
<b>Pittsfield</b> is likely going to be your go-to for a school, home to Berkshire Community College. There<br>is also a museum. Besides that, Berkshire Medical Center. The mall is all but closed.<br><br>
<b>North Adams</b> is another college town, and arguablly the "artsy" region of the county. Home to MASS MoCA,<br>which is a another musem for contempoary art, the largest in the USA.<br><br>
<b>Stockbridge</b>, historic, and famous, due to the Red Lion Inn and Norman Rockwell. Up the street is a,<br>renowed Catholic attraction, The Marian Father's, or the official name:The National Shrine of<br>the Divine Mercy.
 This is also the town that inspired the song, Alice's Restaurant.<br><br>
<b>Great Barrington</b>. This is far from just a name. It indicates its historical signifigance. Had it NOT<br>been for an event in this town, in 1774, we may not have become the country we are today.<br>
To save this from becoming a history journal, in short: we were the first organized resistance against British rule,<br>in thecolonies. We also performed a jail-break as well. Within a year, it was a wave that led<br>
to the battle of Lexington & Concord in 1775. Essentially lighting the fuse for the Revolutionary War. There is<br>a stone commemorrating this outside of the town hall. We were also the first to extend<br>
electrical power more than a mile. We have a picture of a horse and buggy at a stop light, as well. The Revolution<br>was also contingent for the Knox Expedition, taking a cannon from Fort<br>Ticonderoga all the way to Boston.<br><br>
The town is also home to the bowling alley that helped inspire The Big Lebowski, the owner was also one of my<br>coaches, "Red." I was an avid bowler until I joined the adult league.<br><br>
<b>I</b> grew up here, until I moved away in 2003. This was a fantastic area for art and history. We even have a castle.<br>But what really brings me home, is the job with John F. Graney. He fought me even working with him,<br>
but with help and persistence, he relented and allwed me to work there. Honestly, I squandered the resources I had at my<br>fingertips. I learned, yes, but my teenage know-all attitude also prevented me from truley grasping<br>
what I had. I now live in an area with an HOA, and am struggling to get my forge and equipment set up.<br><br>
After leaving home, I moved to Maine, and then eventually joined the Army. Uncle Sam has plopped me here, in Kansas City.<br>
I have ultimately turned to tech for a living.<br><br>
You will see, at the top right, quotes from one of my favorite Philosephers, Diogenes of Sinope, or Diogenes "the Dog."
