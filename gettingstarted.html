This page will serve to share my experience with blacksmithing, some of what I find interesting.<br><br><br>

<h2>Some things about the trade</h2>
<article>
<h4><u>Basic Tools of The Trade</u></h4><p>
<b>Hammer</b> - usually around 1.5 - 2.5 pounds. A good all-around hammer would be a flat faced with<br>
rounded oppoosite face. We then have a straight peen, cross peen, and ball (mechanic's hammer).<br>
Personally, I used a 4lb. short sledge.<br><br>
<b>Tongs</b> - There are a plethora and a half of tongs one could use. The prefered and sought after<br>
are called Wolf Jaw tongs. These are able to hold most common bar stock up to an inch, on the X<br>
and Z axis. For the Y axis, we can simply rotate our wrist 90 degrees.<br><br>
<b>File or Rasp</b> - Allows for material removal in specific areas where a hammer can't. Despite the<br>
answer to all of life's question is to hammer it out, it's not always the best answer.<br><br>
<b>Quench Tub</b> - Water is great for most things, but for fine tools, you should seek another<br>
tub for oil. Used motor oil is a cheap source.<br><br>
<b>Anvil</b> - Perhaps the most expensive tool. Ranging upwards of $,5000 for the BEST. Alternatively,<br>
in a pinch, a chunk of rail from the railroad.<br><br>
<b>FIRE!!</b> - You can beat metals cold but only so much before they become too brittle or too thin.<br>
Fun fact, non-ferrous metals like copper, HARDEN when hammered or worked. You need fire to heat, then<br>
quench them (in water) to aneal (return to base softness) them to work furhter. Where as ferrous<br>
metals require heating and radiative cooling (just leave it alone soomewhere) to aneal it.<br><br>
<b>Apron</b> - What...don't want to get too dirty, do you?<br><br>

<h4><u>Some important Things To Practice</u></h4><p>
<b>Accuracy</b> - Being able to hit the mark is important. If you can't hit the metal, you'll hit the<br>
anvil and dent it. And if you're standing in the wrong spot over the work, it WILL bounce back and<br>
smack you in the face.<br><br>
<b>Timing</b> - You may have seen videos where a smith taps his hammer rhythmically between hammer swings.<br>
This is to create momentum to bring the hammer back up after needing a moment to plan the next hit, or,<br>
when working with others on a large pace, a signal as to when they should swing their hammer. This<br>
technique is used when training an apprecntice to teach them ques.<br><br>
<b>Visual Temperatures</b> - Low-light is a smith's best friend with temperatures. We learn about how<br>
metal changes color based on heat. Anyone who knows anything about crystaline structures & chemistry<br>
knows rxactly what I am referencing. The common item we forge, steel, goes from a dull read at about<br>
500 degrees, to sparking and burning (yes you can burn metal) at 2300 degrees. As we approach the upper<br>
temperature, we would be able to do forge welding, two peices are heated and then hammered together.<br><br>

<h4><u>Things To Make</u></h4><p>
<b>Trinkets</b> - Charm bracelets and charms, keychains, abstract items or representation.<br><br>
<b>Fire Place Screens</b> - Beautiful 3-D art to protect people from getting into a fire, and the fire<br>
spilling out, too.<br><br>
<b>Gates</b> - Think driveways and walkway or garden gates.<br><br>
<b>Fences</b> - To go with the gates or just a beautiful fence on its own.<br><br>
<b>Everyday Items</b> - Cooking utensil, candle holders, lighting, shelves, tables, etc...<br><br>
<b>Historical Items</b> - Swords, knives, armor, and the like.<br><br>

<h2>Examples of what we can do</h2>
<article>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px; color: black; text-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #6a5acd">Favorite One</h4>
Perhaps the most enjoyable object I've ever worked on, is a particular driveway gate for a Native American<br>
casino, Mohegan Sun. In the image below, you will see half the gate. The eagle is almost as tall as one of<br>
the smiths, nearly 6' tall, and one of my mentors, and a certified historical master smith. I helped<br>
repose the animals, patine the copper (make it age to the green color), and also I was responsible for<br>
welding the gate stops.<br>
